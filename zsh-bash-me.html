I am super excited to start working there! I took Front End Development last semester and it has mad me realize that I really enjoy you UI and UX. I hope to pursue this field at Deloitte. I interned at Loopie Laundry and got the opportunity to create thier website. You can find it at <a href="https://www.loopielaundry.com" target="_blank"> here</a>. I hope to advance my development understanding in this class and challenge myself in new ways. I know I am capable of creating great things and want to be more equipt to do so!
